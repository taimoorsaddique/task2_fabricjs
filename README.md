1. Read http://fabricjs.com/articles/
2. Look at Background page image. Make this page using fabricjs. We dont need icon above the menu names. Choose 10 random default colors. If color clicked, the canvas color changes to it. Clicking on download button down the canvas.
3. Look at text page image. Clicking on text menu open the left menu to add an h1 tag, h6 tag or paragraph tag. Clicking one of these add the default text in center of canvas. Clicking on default text can edit. You can move the text around. The 60 dropdown is to set the font size. The trash icon is to delete the text
